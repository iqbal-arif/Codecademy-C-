Q1: In C#, a computer checks for type errors: 
A1: Before a program runs.
👏
Correct! C# is a statically-typed language, so it checks data types before the program is run. 

Q2: Given this variable definition, which statement would throw an error?
```
double num = 3;
```
A2: num.ToUpper();
👏
Correct! This statement would throw an error because it only works with char and string.

Q3: What will the output of this program be?
```
int num = 1;
string population = "all";

Console.WriteLine(num + " ring to rule them " + population);
```
A3: 1 ring to rule them all
👏
Correct! This program uses string concatenation, so it combines different strings together.

double price = 12.3;
```

Q5: Which line of code can we use to convert the int variable speed to a double variable named specificSpeed?
